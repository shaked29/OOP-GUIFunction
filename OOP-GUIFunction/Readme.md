My project enable the user to builds a functions, do an oparations on them, keeps them as a collection and draws them on the screen. my project have a 4 main classes: Polynom, Monom, ComplexFunction and Function_GUI when each of them has functions that can be applied on them.

Monom - mathematical function represent by ax^b, where a real number and b is an none negative integer.

Polynom - form collection of monoms.

ComplexFunction - shape of - Operation(function, function) - when function is Monom, Polynom or ComplexFunction.

Function_GUI - class thats can hold a collection of functions, write and read the functions to file and show them on GUI.
